# Test-task-Zero-LLM

I have leveraged Langchain and Streamlit for rapid development. I had some doubts in identifying what format the date is in, to transform it into the required format later.

Steps to download and use: 
-> Clone the repo
-> Put in a valid openai API key in the helper file

Upload template csv. The script will extract the columns and save them as a list.

Step 2:

Upload the table A/table B CSV. You can see the CSV you uploaded in a tabular format. 

Step 3:

Click on the Map Columns button. This will return the suggested similar columns identified by the LLM and the reason behind this identification.

Step 4:

Click on transform. This will convert the data frame into the required template format.
